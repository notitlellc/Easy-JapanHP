        　Below is an explanation of the plan, how to apply, cancellation policy, precautions, etc. for using Easy Japan.
        If you have any questions about something that is not listed here, please use the <b><a href="../inquiry/ENGLISHinquiry.html">"Inquiry"</a></b> section of this website.

                    - What is Easy Japan?
                </h3>
        </center>
        　Easy Japan is a service provided by Japanese staff to help foreigners live a more comfortable life in Japan.
        For example, we have a "Help plan" where you can discuss any problems you may have with living in Japan in a chat format, and an "Itinerary agent plan" where you can suggest an itinerary in Japan.
        Details of the "Help plan" and "Itinerary agent plan" are shown below, so please see below and the <b><a href="../plan_Free_version/ENGLISHplan.html">"Plan List"</a></b> for details.<br>
        　This service was started by three university students with the desire to make traveling and studying abroad in Japan easier and more secure.
        Even if you are not good at Japanese or have no friends in Japan, we aim to provide a service that allows you to enjoy Japan with peace of mind by using this service.<br>
        <br>

                - Help plan -
            </h3>

        </center>
        　With this plan, you can discuss any problems you may have with living in Japan in a chat format using SNS.
        We offer two plans: a plan for travelers and a plan for long-term residents, and both offer complete individual support 365 days a year.
        We also accept questions about Japanese culture and manners, consultations about problems, and other questions about Japanese history.
        Since it is compatible with various SNS, you can use it from the preparation stage for coming to Japan. <br>
        *We will not be able to purchase, reserve, or arrange transportation services, accommodation services, tickets, goods sales, paid guides (excluding free guides, national guide interpreters, regional guide interpreters, etc.) on behalf of our customers. <br>
         (We can teach you how to purchase, make reservations, and make arrangements.)

                - Itinerary agent plan -
            </h3>
        </center>
        　With this plan, we will propose an itinerary in Japan instead.
        It is subdivided into three grades: basic, standard, and premium, allowing customers to choose the proposal method that best suits them.
        Since this plan offers individual support for all grades, we are able to propose the most suitable itinerary while consulting with customers via various SNS and email.
        Some plans can also be made to order.
        Since we have history experts on our staff, we can also assist you with tours of historic sites for enthusiasts. <br>
        *We will not be able to purchase, reserve, or arrange transportation services, accommodation services, tickets, goods sales, paid guides (excluding free guides, national guide interpreters, regional guide interpreters, etc.) on behalf of our customers.<br>

            <h4>
                - Basic -
            </h4>
        </center>
        　With Basic Grade, we will select and propose the most optimal itinerary for your needs from the itineraries we have prepared in advance.
        The contents of the itinerary are arranged in order of ease of visiting recommended spots.
        Since the scheduled time and means of transportation are not determined, it is easy for you to customize the content themselves.
        *We do not accept custom-made itinerary for this grade.

                - Standard -
            </h4>
        </center>
        　For Standard Grade, we will create a semi-customized itinerary based on the itinerary that we have prepared in advance, according to the customer's requests.
        The itinerary consists of recommended spots and spots you want to visit arranged in an order that is easy to visit.
        With this plan, it is possible to create a intinerary that includes setting the scheduled time.
        Since everything except the means of transportation is predetermined, the burden on the customer can be kept to a minimum.
        <br>

            <h4>
                - Premium -
            </h4>
        </center>
        　With Premium Grade, we will create a fully custom-made itinerary to suit your needs.
        The content of the itinerary is arranged in the order of ease of visiting the spots the customer wants to visit, and incorporates time settings.
        With this plan, it is possible to create a itinerary that includes setting the scheduled time and describing the means of transportation such as public transportation (boarding station, destination, getting off station, etc.).
        Since you do not need to create it yourself, you can smoothly sightsee without getting confused, even if it is your first time visiting Japan.

        </center>
        　This service is currently in trial operation.
        In order to develop this service as a business later on, our goal is to have customers actually use it and reflect customer feedback more fully.
        Therefore, we ask our customers to cooperate with our survey.
        Additionally, all plans are currently available for free, but we are considering making this service a paid service after a certain period of time.
        Currently, we do not have a concrete plan for the period, but we plan to make an announcement as soon as it is decided.
        If you apply during the trial period, there will be no charge in principle.
        However, please note that if you apply for continuation or reapply after the monitoring period ends, the regular fee will be charged. (*In that case, the staff will confirm.)

         In addition, customer information will only be used for business purposes in order to smoothly provide services, and will not be used for any other purpose.
